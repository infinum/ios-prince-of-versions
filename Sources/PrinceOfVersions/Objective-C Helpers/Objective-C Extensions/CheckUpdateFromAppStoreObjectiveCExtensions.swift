     Used for getting the versioning information from the AppStore Connect.

     After check with server is finished, this method will return all informations about the app versioning available on the AppStore Connect.
     It's up to the user to handle that info in a way sutable for the app.

     Update status can only take on value `UpdateStatus.noUpdateAvailable` or `UpdateStatus.newUpdateAvailable`, but it can't be `UpdateStatus.requiredUpdateNeeded` since there is no way to determine if the update version is mandatory with this check.

     Flag `trackPhaseRelese` will be set to `YES`.
     If flag `trackPhaseRelease` is set to `NO`, the value of the `phaseReleaseInProgress` will instantly be `NO` as phased release is not used.
     Otherwise, if we have to check `trackPhaseRelease`, value of `phaseReleaseInProgress` will return `NO` once phased release period of 7 days is over.

     __WARNING:__ As we are not able to determine if phased release period is finished earlier (release to all options is selected after a while), if `trackPhaseRelease` is enabled `phaseReleaseInProgress` will return `NO` only after 7 days of `currentVersionReleaseDate` value set on AppStore Connect.

     - Parameter completion: The completion handler to call when the load request is complete. It returns result that contains UpdatInfo data or PoVError error

     - returns: Discardable `URLSessionDataTask`

     - Parameters:

     If parameter `notificationFrequency` is set to `.always`  and latest version of the app is bigger than installed version, method will always return `.newUpdateAvailable`. However, if the`notificationFrequency` is set to `.once`, only first time this method is called for the same latest app version, it will return `.newUpdateAvailable`, each subsequent call, it will return `.noUpdateAvailable`.

     - Parameters:
        * bundle: Bundle where .plist file is stored in which app identifier and app versions should be checked.
        * trackPhaseRelease: Boolean that indicates whether PoV should notify about new version after 7 days when app is fully rolled out or immediately. Default value is `YES`.
        * callbackQueue: The queue on which the completion handler is dispatched. By default, `main` queue is used.
        * notificationFrequency: Determines update status appearance frequency.
        * completion: The completion handler to call when the load request is complete. It returns result that contains UpdatInfo data or PoVError error

     - Returns:
        * Discardable `URLSessionDataTask`
